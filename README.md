# ix7
IX7 is the Integra "DX" emulation system used to emulate Yamaha DX-series synths

This project attempts to provide easy-to-build-and-use versions of the pluginhost~ DSSI host for Pure Data and the Hexter DX7 emulator. The aim is to automated builds of these components for both OS X and Linux making it trivial to get DX7 emulation running with the latest version of Pure Data.
